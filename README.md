# To do
- add '#require <functions.h>'  
    works like:  
    while reading, save all definitions (' _indent..._  **def** _name_(_args_...)') to list as well as their position (horisontal indent + vertial line)  
    after writing **all file** (because requiered definions can also be after the '#requiere' statement and that's file as long as they are visible), check if #requiere's are met
